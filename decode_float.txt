Program that pareses a bit string to get floating point value
- Program takes CLIA that will be a file
	Need some type of way to read the file and get the info out of it
		use operator >> to get word into a variable
		there are a possible of 3! combinations that can occur with the file
	Get the number of bits for man and exp
		A bunch of if statments
	**File will specify order of the sign, matisssa, and exponent
	**FIle will also have the number of bits for each except sign
- Program should prompt user for bit string
	If user enters bit string wrong keep on prompting(some type of while loop)
		Error message indicating error -> to std::out
- Once acceptable bit string -> convert to flaoting-point value and return value
	Get Mantissa
		Pass through a sub-string or only the matissa portion
		Use bit-wise to check to see if there's a one
		If there is a one:
			result+= 2^(frac) where frac = -1 and decrement every iteration
		Decrement the exponent with every iteration until the end of the string
		Add one to total result and return
	Get Exponent
		Get Bias
			Get n from either the txt file or the sub-string exponent length
			Bias = 2^(n-1) - 1 -> decimal number
		Convert exponent binary section to decimal
		Subtract binary decimal by bias decimal number -> yields exponent
	Get Sign
		Sign will have to be extracted by looking one over the one before it
			If sign bit < 0:
				Multiply result by -1
			Some type of extra check to see if there is a one in the sign place
	Combine everything
		Multiply the mantissa by 2^(exponent) * sign -- (Should be either +/- or -1/1)
--------------------------------------------------------
Notes:
	Exponent is stored with a bias
		Bias is 2^n - 1 (n is the number of bits used for the exponent)
		"the bias should be subtracted when you are converting from the bit pattern
		to the actual base 10 exponent"
	Always implicit leading 1 with the mantissa
	Floating point-rep will NOT take more than 32 bits
		Exponent will not have more than 8 bits

Mantissa is the fractional component
Exponent is the exponent
sign will be given in the number usually at end of it 
Ex 4.256 * 10^7
	Mantissa = .256
	Exponent = 7
